//! Active trapframe tracking.
//!
//! This module provides a tiny facility to expose the *current* trapframe
//! (register snapshot) to external callers (e.g. a pseudo-NMI watchdog).
//!
//! ## Design notes
//! - We only keep a single pointer per CPU *logically* (the most inner trap).
//! - The storage itself is a single atomic pointer. This is already useful on
//!   uniprocessor builds and is safe to call from interrupt/NMI-like contexts.
//! - If you need full per-CPU + nested trap support, this can be extended to a
//!   per-CPU stack later.

/// # Safety & lifetime
/// The returned reference is valid only while the CPU is still in the trap
/// context where the trapframe lives on the stack. Therefore, callers should
/// treat it as a short-lived snapshot: use it immediately and don't store it.
